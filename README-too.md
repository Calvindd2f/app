## Extend with Custom Automations

## Closing the automation gap with Custom Automations

+ Tailor to your Client needs
+ Integrates with your toolset
+ Extend existing automations

From integrating with the chatbot to integrating with external services, custom automations can simplify your workflow, improve customer experience, and boost your team's productivity.

Automation packages are executed on app's automation engine (aka "Orchestrator") - the automation engine's job is to determine how/when automations should run and to coordinate each step of the automation by tracking its inputs, outputs and overall execution flow.

Every step of an automation package can be monitored live as it execute's in real time. Whether you run an automation via app Chatbox or a scheduled automation, you can always go to the Live Packages View to see the live activity log output of a running automation.

## Key features

1. ðŸ’¬ **Use the chatbot to ask questions and provide information**: Interact with the engineer through the chatbot to gather relevant information or notify them of issues in real-time. Ensure your support engineers have all the necessary information and resources at their fingertips.
2. ðŸŽ« **Integrate with the ticketing system**: Get information and make changes to the ticketing system from your automation.
3. ðŸ“‹ **Create custom forms**: Design and implement custom forms tailored to your specific needs.
