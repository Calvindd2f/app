To begin planning your "chatbot and website with SPA and architecture", we'll start by structuring the information you've provided into a specific document. We'll address each section one at a time, starting with the background, to ensure the design meets all the specified requirements and features.

Let's start by defining the Background and Requirements of the project based on the details you've shared.

Background
The project aims to develop a comprehensive platform, named app, which integrates a chatbot and various automation components into a single-page application (SPA). The goal is to enhance operational efficiency through advanced automation, secure and distributed architecture, and scalable solutions. The platform will comply with international security standards like ISO 27001 and will include various components such as local execution capabilities on client devices, integration with IoT and REST APIs, and smart communication features.

Requirements
The requirements will be structured based on the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Would have) for clarity and prioritization:

Must Have:

Distributed architecture compliant with ISO 27001.
A chatbot integrated into a ticketing system capable of executing packages and handling communications via SignalR web sockets.
Local execution of automation packages on client devices without needing central processing.
Integration with IoT devices and external APIs for enhanced communication and functionality.
SPA for centralized monitoring and management of automation tasks.
Should Have:

Supervised machine learning model to classify tickets and automate package matching.
Scalable solutions that can adapt to increasing loads without degradation in performance.
Could Have:

Integration with existing ticketing systems like AutoTask, ConnectWise, and ServiceNow.
Advanced ticket triage features using AI for automated classification and routing.
Would Have:

Extended custom automation capabilities to adapt to specific client needs.
Before moving on to the next sections (Method, Implementation, etc.), could you confirm if this captures the initial scope accurately, or if there are any adjustments you would like to make? Also, for the chatbot and SPA, could you specify any particular technologies or frameworks you prefer, such as React for the SPA or a specific NLP library for the chatbot?
